<h1>Data Analytics ETL Group Project Proposal</h1>

For our group project we are going to explore the historical data on fires and droughts in California for the past twenty years. Our sources are CaliforniaData.gov and Drought.gov. We extracted csv files from each site and transformed the data with Python and Pandas libraries. The data consists of one file for the fire data, that lists each fire from the past twenty years along with size and dates, and another csv for drought severity on a scale of 0-100% for the past twenty years. 

We are going to combine the data to analyze the relationships between the drought levels and the acres burned for each year. Then we will load the data into a PostgreSQL database.

## Findings
We chose this topic because Disneyland is a very well-known place worldwide, and we recognize that a lot of data can be found on the parks. We have tried through these datasets to find some informative insights about Disneyland, extract some conclusions from Disneyland reviews and make a sentiment analysis.
